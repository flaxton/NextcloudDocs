### What is Nextcloud?

&nbsp;

Nextcloud is a document management system. It is used to share folders and files between others in your organization and also outsiders if you wish.

You can access Nextcloud in two ways:

* In a web browser, like Google Chrome
* As a folder on your computer, similar to Dropbox or other cloud services

[Use Nextcloud in a web browser](#web-browser)

Using a web browser, you login to Nextcloud and then you can see all your documents and folders, as well as folders and documents shared with others. You can download, view and upload new documents, if you are given access to do so.

_Note - use a web browser if you are low on disk space on your computer_

You must have Internet access while using Nextcloud in a web browser.

[Use Nextcloud on your computer - Install on your computer](#desktop-client)

By installing the Nextcloud software, a folder on your computer will be kept in sync with the Nextcloud system, including all folders and documents you have been granted permission to access.

In this mode, you work directly on the files on your computer, and the Nextcloud software keeps it in sync with the Nextcloud server automatically.

_Note - using Nextcloud as a folder on your computer may use a lot of disk space. It will download a copy of all files and folders you have been granted permission to access, to your computer._

-> You can use your Nextcloud files and folders, even without an Internet connection. The next time you have an Internet connection, the Nextcloud software will synchronize the changes you and others have made to the files and folders.

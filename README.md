[Use Nextcloud on your computer as a "Network Drive" while online - more info](#network-drive)

[Use Nextcloud on your computer, synced to a local folder - Install on your computer](#desktop-client)

By installing the Nextcloud software, a folder on your computer will be kept in sync with the Nextcloud system, including all folders and documents you have been granted permission to access.

In this mode, you work directly on the files on your computer, and the Nextcloud software keeps it in sync with the Nextcloud server automatically.

_Note - using Nextcloud as a folder on your computer may use a lot of disk space. It will download a copy of all files and folders you have been granted permission to access, to your computer._

> You can use your Nextcloud files and folders, even without an Internet connection. The next time you have an Internet connection, the Nextcloud software will synchronize the changes you and others have made to the files and folders.

### <a name="accessing-your-files"></a>Accessing your files using the Nextcould Web interface

&nbsp;

---
&nbsp;

You can access your Nextcloud files with the Nextcloud Web interface and create, preview, edit, delete, share, and re-share files.

![User Files](./users-files.png "User Files")



#### File controls

Nextcloud can display thumbnail previews for image files, MP3 covers, and text files, if this enabled by your server administrator. Hover your cursor over a file or folder to expose the controls for the following operations:

##### Favorites

Click the star to the left of the file icon to mark it as a favorite, and quickly find all of your favorites with the Favorites filter on the left sidebar.

![Favorites](./files_page-1.png "Favorites")


##### Share

Share the file or folder with a group or other users, and create public shares with hyperlinks. You can also see who you have shared with already, and revoke shares by clicking the trash can icon.

![Sharing Files](./files_page-2.png "Sharing Files")

You have five share permissions:

* Can share; allows the users you share with to re-share.
* Can edit; allows the users you share with to edit your shared files, and to collaborate using the Documents app.
* Create; allows the users you share with to create new files and add them to the share.
* Change; allows uploading a new version of a shared file and replacing it.
* Delete; allows the users you share with to delete shared files.

##### Overflow Menu

The Overflow menu (three dots) displays file details, and allows you to rename, download, or delete files.

![Overflow Menu](./files_page-3.png "Overflow Menu")


_The Details view shows Activities, Sharing, and Versions information._

![Details view](./files_page-4.png "Details view")

The **Settings** gear icon at the lower left allows you to show or hide hidden files in your Nextcloud Web interface. These are also called dotfiles, because they are prefixed with a dot, e.g. .mailfile. The dot tells your operating system to hide these files in your file browsers, unless you choose to display them. Usually these are configuration files, so having the option to hide them reduces clutter.

![Hidden Files](./hidden_files.png "Hidden Files")

Hiding or displaying hidden files.



##### Previewing files

You can display uncompressed text files, OpenDocument files, videos, and image files in the Nextcloud embedded viewers by clicking on the file name. There may be other file types you can preview if your Nextcloud administrator has enabled them. If Nextcloud cannot display a file, it starts a download process and downloads the file to your computer.

##### Navigating inside your Nextcloud

Navigating through folders in Nextcloud is as simple as clicking on a folder to open it and using the back button on your browser to move to a previous level. Nextcloud also provides a navigation bar at the top of the Files field for quick navigation.

##### Sharing status icons

Any folder that has been shared is marked with the Shared overlay icon. Public link shares are marked with a chain link. Un-shared folders are blank.

![Share Status icons](./files_page-5.png "Share Status icons")

##### Creating or uploading files and directories

Upload or create new files or folders directly in a Nextcloud folder by clicking on the New button in the Files app.

![The New file/folder/upload menu](./files_page-6.png "The New file/folder/upload menu")

The New button provides the following options:

**Up arrow**

* Upload files from your computer into Nextcloud. You can also upload files by dragging and dropping them from your file manager.

**Text file**

* Creates a new text file and adds the file to your current folder.

**Folder**

* Creates a new folder in the current folder.

##### Selecting files or folders

You can select one or more files or folders by clicking on their checkboxes. To select all files in the current directory, click on the checkbox located at the top of the files listing.

When you select multiple files, you can delete all of them, or download them as a ZIP file by using the Delete or Download buttons that appear at the top.

> **Note** If the Download button is not visible, the administrator has disabled this feature.

##### Filtering the files view

The left sidebar on the Files page contains several filters for quickly sorting and managing your files.

**All files**

* The default view; displays all files that you have access to.

**Favorites**

* Files or folders marked with the yellow star.

**Shared with you**

* Displays all files shared with you by another user or group.

**Shared with others**

**Shared by link**

* Displays all files that are shared by you via public link.

##### Moving files

You can move files and folders by dragging and dropping them into any directory.

##### Change in share expiration date

In older versions of Nextcloud, you could set an expiration date on both local and public shares. Now you can set an expiration date only on public shares, and local shares do not expire when public shares expire. The only way to “expire” a local share is to click the trash can icon to un-share your files.

### <a name="network-drive"></a>Network Drive Usage

&nbsp;

---
&nbsp;

**What is a "Network Drive" and why would you use it?**

A Network Drive is a "drive" that connects over the Internet. Once you connect, it is like another hard drive on your computer. On Windows it would be another drive letter, like Z:. On a Mac, it is another disk volume.

**Why would you use Nextcloud this way?**

A Network Drive has the convenience of a local hard drive, but takes no space on your computer. So if your computer has limited disk space, you can use a Network Drive, instead of using the Nextcloud Sync client (detailed in the next section), which copies ALL of the files/folders to your computer, potentially using a lot of disk space.

**Why would you not use a Network Drive?**

* If you are a light user of Nextcloud, the web browser interface is probably enough for you.

* If you have a slow Internet connection, a Network Drive will be slow to respond. This is because it downloads every file on demand when you access it, or uploads every file when you add it. The Desktop Sync client, on the other hand, syncs in the background, so that when you go to access a file, it has already been downloaded to your computer (using disk space), so there is no delay. The downside of the Desktop Sync client is the files take space on your computer.

* If you want your Nextcloud files/folders at all times, including when you are offline, such as when traveling, you would want to use the Nextcloud Sync client instead (next section). This keeps all of the files/folders synced on your computer. If you modify files/folders while offline, those will be synced with Nextcloud the next time you are online.

> To use a Network Drive on Nextcloud, [contact Fred Laxton](http://infotechdesign.net/www/contact) - the setup is somewhat technical and custom for each user.
